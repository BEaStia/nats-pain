# Nats::Pain

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/nats/pain`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'nats-pain'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install nats-pain

## Usage

This gem simplifies usage of nats and nats-streaming in pair.

In Iconjob company we have created a very exact delivering nats message system.

Firstly it tries to send message with Nats-streaming, then with regular nats.
All messages have their own transactions. 

So consuming services would not make any duplications. **It's strongly recommended to be implemented!**
